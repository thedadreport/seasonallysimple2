IMPORTANT: Adjust the recipe complexity based on the difficulty level:
- **Easy**: Use simple techniques, common ingredients, minimal steps, basic seasoning. Perfect for beginners or busy weeknights.
- **Intermediate**: Include some cooking techniques like saut√©ing, braising, or reduction. May require 1-2 specialty ingredients or equipment.
- **Expert**: Advanced techniques like tempering, emulsification, or complex flavor building. Multiple cooking stages, specialized equipment, or restaurant-style presentations are appropriate.

CRITICAL VARIETY REQUIREMENTS - AVOID REPETITION:
üö´ **NO DUPLICATE PROTEINS:** Each meal MUST use a different primary protein. Do not repeat chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc. across meals.
üö´ **NO DUPLICATE COOKING METHODS:** Each meal should use a different primary cooking method (grilled, roasted, stir-fried, braised, baked, pan-seared, etc.)
üö´ **NO REPETITIVE SIDES:** Avoid repeating the same side dishes. No more than 1 roasted vegetable dish, 1 rice dish, 1 potato dish across the entire plan.
üö´ **NO SIMILAR FLAVOR PROFILES:** Vary seasonings and cuisines - don't default to basic herbs like rosemary/garlic for multiple meals.

MANDATORY PROTEIN VARIETY (choose different ones):
- Chicken (but vary: thighs, breast, whole pieces - only use ONCE)
- Beef (ground, steak, stew meat, etc. - only use ONCE) 
- Pork (chops, tenderloin, ground, etc. - only use ONCE)
- Fish/Seafood (salmon, white fish, shrimp, etc. - only use ONCE)
- Vegetarian proteins (beans, lentils, tofu, eggs, etc. - only use ONCE)
- Turkey, lamb, or other proteins if needed for variety

IMPORTANT MEAL STRUCTURE: Each dinner should consist of:
- 1 MAIN DISH (protein-focused: meat, fish, vegetarian protein, etc.)
- 2 SIDE DISHES (vegetables, starches, grains, salads - should complement the main)

üçΩÔ∏è **CLASSIC DINNER PRESENTATION - AVOID "BOWL" FORMATS:**
Create traditional, familiar dinner plates that families recognize, NOT trendy bowl meals.

PREFERRED FORMATS:
‚úÖ "Baked Salmon with Lemon Herb Potatoes and Green Beans"
‚úÖ "Chicken Parmesan with Spaghetti and Caesar Salad"  
‚úÖ "Beef Stir-Fry with Steamed Rice and Egg Rolls"
‚úÖ "Pork Chops with Mashed Potatoes and Roasted Carrots"
‚úÖ "Taco Tuesday with Ground Beef Tacos, Spanish Rice, and Refried Beans"

AVOID THESE TRENDY FORMATS:
‚ùå "Ginger-Soy Glazed Salmon Bowl"
‚ùå "Chili-Lime Chicken Fiesta Bowl" 
‚ùå "Mediterranean Grain Bowl"
‚ùå "Asian Fusion Bowl"
‚ùå "Buddha Bowl" or any "__ Bowl" naming

Use classic main-and-sides presentation that feels like traditional home cooking, not restaurant trends.

COOKING METHOD DISTRIBUTION: Distribute meals across different cooking methods (${formData.cookingMethods.join(', ')}) - ensure each meal uses a DIFFERENT primary method. Examples: grilled, roasted, stir-fried, braised, pan-seared, slow-cooked, baked, etc.

CUISINE INTEGRATION: When "No specific preference" is selected, create a DIVERSE mix of cuisine styles across the meal plan. Include different global flavors like Italian, Mexican, Asian, Mediterranean, American, etc. When specific cuisines are preferred (${formData.cuisinePreferences.join(', ')}), distribute them evenly but still ensure variety within each cuisine style.

EXAMPLE CLASSIC DINNER FORMATS (DO NOT COPY - CREATE YOUR OWN VARIED MEALS):
- Monday: Italian - Chicken Parmesan with Spaghetti and Garlic Breadsticks
- Tuesday: Mexican - Ground Beef Tacos with Spanish Rice and Refried Beans  
- Wednesday: American - Baked Meatloaf with Mashed Potatoes and Green Bean Casserole
- Thursday: Mediterranean - Herb-Crusted Salmon with Rice Pilaf and Roasted Zucchini
- Friday: Asian - Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry with Jasmine Rice and Spring Rolls

**FOCUS ON FAMILIAR CLASSICS:** Think traditional family dinners, comfort food, and recognizable combinations that feel like home cooking - NOT trendy restaurant concepts or "bowl" meals.

IMPORTANT: If you cannot clearly read parts of the recipe, make reasonable culinary assumptions based on:
- The type of dish you can identify
- Standard cooking methods for that type of food
- Common ingredient proportions
- Typical cooking times and techniques

If dietary restrictions are specified, modify ingredients and instructions accordingly while maintaining the essence of the original recipe.
